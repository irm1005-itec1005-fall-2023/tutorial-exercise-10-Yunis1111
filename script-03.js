/* Tutorial Exercise 10
 *
 * In Step 03 we're going to be adding new
 * Pokemons to the list on the page.
 *
 * Follow the instructions below
 *
 * For this exercise, you are going to use event delegation
 * to find out what index or id a button click
 * event is coming from.
 *
 * You will have to write an event handler and
 * register to listen to the event on click.
 *
 * The event handler should be registered to the parent UL.
 * There are some instructions to help you, though
 * there are many different ways you could acheive
 * the desired outcome.
